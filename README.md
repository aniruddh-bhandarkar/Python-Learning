# Python-Learning
This is the first programming language for which I had to read indepth about the workings of the various data structures and touched upon a few sorting algorithms as in the Syllabus and I have now segregated my code into Python Learnings and Python Projects directories so as to accomodate my upcoming Project in Python Language.
Using this for more advance topics such as Machine Learning with updated learnings in Linear Algebra, Software Design and Data Structures and Algorithms.
